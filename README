Imagen Project README File

INTRODUCTION
------------

This is the README file for the devdaily.com Imagen
project.

The best way to describe Imagen is to see the demo video:

  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AJxPzpiVjQ

As you can see from that video, Imagen:

  * Lets you drag and drop images.
  * The images are displayed in borderless windows.
  * You can resize images.
  * You can crop images.
  * You can open multiple images by dropping them on
    the Imagen icon in the dock.
  * As you can see in the related video on YouTube,
    you can also "throw" Imagen windows across the
    screen.


SOURCE CODE
-----------

The Imagen source code is admittedly pretty crappy. I just through this
together to see if I could make it work, and to see where it took me. 

I don't have any interest in cleaning up the code right now, but thought 
I'd share it here in case anyone wanted to see how to do things like 
this with the Java Swing framework.


BULDING IMAGEN
--------------

If you have Java and Ant installed, you can build Imagen. Just cd 
to the build directory, and type "ant". Or, take a look at the
build.xml file in that directory for more information.
